Problem statement
You have been given an array 'PRICES' consisting of 'N' integers where PRICES[i] denotes the price of a given stock on the i-th day. You are also given an integer 'K' denoting the number of possible transactions you can make.

Your task is to find the maximum profit in at most K transactions. A valid transaction involves buying a stock and then selling it.

Note
You canâ€™t engage in multiple transactions simultaneously, i.e. you must sell the stock before rebuying it.
For Example
Input: N = 6 , PRICES = [3, 2, 6, 5, 0, 3] and K = 2.
Output: 7

Explanation : The optimal way to get maximum profit is to buy the stock on day 2(price = 2) and sell it on day 3(price = 6) and rebuy it on day 5(price = 0) and sell it on day 6(price = 3). The maximum profit will be (6 - 2) + (3 - 0) = 7.

Explanation for Sample 1
Test Case 1: In this case, we can make a maximum of 2 transactions. The optimal way to get maximum profit is to make only 1 transaction, i.e., buy the stock on day 3 (price = 1) and sell it on day 5(price = 10). The profit will be 10 - 1 = 9.

Test Case 2: In the second test case, we can make a maximum of 2 transactions. The optimal way to get maximum profit is to make 0 transactions because the price of stock is continuously decreasing and we will have a loss if we buy and sell the stock.
